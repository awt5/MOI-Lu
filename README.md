# MOI

Multilanguage Online IDE was created to write code wherever you are

## Characteristics
* Handles Java, Python and C# languages
* Runs a folder project with a single file or multiple files
* Accepts the interaction with the user
* Uses Docker to build and deploy the Database
* Uses JPA and hibernate to write endpoints
* Uses Swagger to visualize and interact with the API
* Controls the authorization with JWT
* Loggers configured

## Set up environment

1. Set Up Languages Compilers
2. Set Up Database
3. Review properties


## 1. Set Up Languages Compilers
### To Use Java Compiler
For this version we are using the more popular version of java language for Windows
You need to have it installed in your local.

1. Download Java SE Development Kit 8 here.
2. Install Java jdk 1.8
3. Include JDK's "bin" Directory in the PATH and JAVA_HOME

### To Use Python Compiler
We are using a portable version of python that you can find it into the path:

```
thirdparty/python/win/python32/Portable_Python_3.2.5.1.zip
```

- Unzip the file in the same folder:
the final path should be
```
H:\MOI\thirdparty\python\win\python32\Portable_Python_3.2.5.1\App\python.exe
```
Now you are able to use Python language with the app.

## To Use CSharp Compiler
-	To compile C# files this project uses "C:/Windows/Microsoft.NET/Framework64/v4.0.30319/csc.exe " as default windows compiler path, this would be chage in case to use other Operative System
